    <p> <strong>Disclosures:</strong><br>
      1. New personal checking account must be opened online between 8/01/12 and 12/31/12. To qualify for the $150 reward, a qualifying Direct Deposit must be received, and one (1) payment must be completed via PNC Online Bill Pay within 60 days of account opening. Your checking account must remain open in order for you to receive the $150 reward, which will be credited to the eligible account within 60 days after both conditions have been met and will be identified as "Cash Trans Promo Reward" on your monthly statement. A qualifying Direct Deposit is defined as a recurring Direct Deposit of a paycheck, pension, Social Security or other regular monthly income electronically deposited by an employer or an outside agency into a Performance or Performance Select Checking Account, or the Spend Account of a Virtual Wallet® with Performance Spend. The total amount of all qualifying Direct Deposits credited to your checking account must be at least $2,000. Credit card cash advance transfers, transfers from one account to another or deposits made at a branch or ATM do not qualify as Qualifying Direct Deposits. Offer only available to new PNC Bank checking account customers who open the Eligible Account using the online application or present a coupon in branch. New account will not be eligible for offer if any signer has signing authority on an existing PNC Bank consumer checking account, has closed an account within the past 90 days, or has been paid a promotional premium in the past 12 months. If multiple accounts are opened with the same signers, only one account will be eligible for the premium. For this offer, signing authority will be defined by the customer name(s) and Social Security number(s) registered on the account. Offer only available to residents of AL, DC, DE, FL, GA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MI, MO, NC, NJ, OH, PA, SC, VA and WI. Offer may be extended, modified or discontinued at any time and may vary by market. </p>
    <p> In the event that we determine in our sole discretion that your account does not meet the eligibility criteria or the activity on your account does not qualify as a qualifying Direct Deposit, we will not be obligated to credit your account with the payout. </p>
    <p> 2. PNC does not charge a fee for Mobile Banking. However, your wireless carrier may charge you for data usage and text messaging services. Check with your wireless carrier for details regarding your specific wireless plan and any data usage or text messaging charges that may apply. Also, a supported mobile device is needed to use the Mobile Banking App. Mobile Deposit is a feature of PNC Mobile Banking. Use of the Mobile Deposit feature requires a supported camera-equipped device and you must download a PNC mobile banking app. Eligible PNC Bank account and PNC Bank Online Banking required. Certain other restrictions apply. See the mobile banking terms and conditions in the PNC Online Banking Service Agreement. </p>
    <p> Online Banking is free to customers with an eligible account; however there may be a fee for certain optional services. We reserve the right to decline or revoke access to Online Banking or any of its services. All online banking services are subject to and conditional upon adherence to the terms and conditions of the PNC Online Banking Service Agreement. </p>
    <p> 3. Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend provides automatic reimbursement of non-PNC Bank ATM fees. Other financial institutions' surcharge fees will be reimbursed up to $8 maximum at the end of the statement period. </p>

        PNC has numerous patents/pending patent applications directed at various features and functions of Virtual Wallet.</div>
      <br>
      <sup>1</sup> Offers are available only from participating merchants. Your personal banking information is not shared with the merchants participating in PNC Purchase Payback. IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT PNC POINTS &amp; PNC PURCHASE PAYBACK: The PNC points Program is being discontinued for customers with PNC Bank Visa Check Cards. However, the PNC Purchase Payback Rewards Program will be enhanced to offer cash rewards to eligible debit and credit customers for qualifying purchases at participating merchants. Currently if you have a Business Check Card or a Check Card associated with a Performance or Performance Select checking account or Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend, it is eligible to enroll or link in PNC points. However, you will no longer be able to enroll or link any Check Card(s) in PNC points on or after November 1, 2012. Any Check Cards enrolled or linked in PNC points before November 1, 2012 will continue to earn points through January 31, 2013. If your Check Card isn't linked to a PNC points participating credit card in your name, the points in your account must be redeemed before December 1, 2013 or they will be forfeited. PNC points Visa Business credit cards will be auto-enrolled in PNC points beginning October 7, 2012 and new PNC points Visa and PNC Flex Visa credit cards will continue to be automatically enrolled in PNC points and will continue to enjoy the benefits of the PNC points Program. See PNC points Program Terms and Conditions. Credit cards subject to credit approval. <br>
      <sup>2</sup> If you make at least 5 qualifying purchases in a month with your Virtual Wallet Check Card or a PNC credit card included in your Virtual Wallet, you'll earn the relationship rate on your Growth account for the following month. <br>
      <sup>3</sup> Covers up to $5,000 out of pocket expenses incurred to regain your identity and to repair your credit. Certain restrictions and deductibles apply. See the Summary Description of Benefits for the Personal, Internet and Identity Coverage Master Policy for details. Coverage applies to Primary Checking account only, not to additional checking, savings or money market accounts. <br>
      <sup>4</sup> If you exceed the 3 checks per monthly statement cycle limit, you will be charged a fee of $.50 per check. <br>
      <sup>5</sup> A qualifying direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit made by an employer or an outside agency. Transfers made from one account to another or deposits made via a branch, ATM, online transfer, mobile device, or the mail are not eligible to meet this requirement. <br>
      <sup>6</sup> Combined average monthly balance in checking, savings, money market, investments, installment loans, lines of credit and mortgage applies.  Some accounts may not be eligible to be included in the combined average monthly balance requirement based on titling structure, product type or other constraints.  A maximum of ten (10) linked PNC accounts, including this account, maybe included in the combined average monthly balance relationship.  The outstanding balance on lines of credit, and the original principal amount on installment and mortgage loans, will be used to determine the combined average monthly balance.  Only investments or annuities linked to a PNC Investments account are eligible to be included in the combined average monthly balance requirement. <br>
