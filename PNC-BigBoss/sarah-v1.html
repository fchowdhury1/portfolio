            <h2>Spending Zone</h2>
            <p>It's easy for money to fly out the door, especially when you're having fun. Spending Zone's Spendology<sup>SM</sup> tools provide a simple way to see exactly what you're spending your money on each month — and get a hold on it. Broken down into categories like Education, Restaurants, Gas and more, it allows you to set a budget for each. You can also opt to get handy reminder emails if you're close to maxing out your budget for any category. That way, you can hit the brakes before going over the edge.</p>

            <h2>Savings Engine®</h2>
            <p>You can't always think about saving, especially when you're too busy spending. That's why we built the Savings Engine. It gives you three easy ways to put cash aside — even when saving is not exactly top-of-mind. With the Payday Savings rule, a predetermined amount will automatically transfer from Spend to Growth on days you've designated as pay days. Bill Pay makes it easy to transfer money to Growth whenever you pay a bill online from your Calendar. Punch the Pig® is an on-the-fly way to add money to Growth while you're banking online. Whether you use one or all three, we'll make sure your savings routine stays at full throttle.</p>

You can also see any impending Danger Days<sup>SM</sup> and use Online Bill Pay, which means worrying less and making sure late payments don't happen again. Feeling better already, aren't you?</p>

              <p>I did a lot of research when I wanted to switch banks and thanks to a friend I looked at PNC’s virtual wallet account. Thanks to this account I have never felt more in control of my money. From day to day spending, account balance alerts, and the freedom to move money between my spending and saving account I finally feel like I’m in charge of my money instead of a bank telling me what to do. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any better the Virtual Wallet app opened new doors to mobile money transfers and bill pay. ATM and brand convenience has simply been the icing on the cake. Thank you.</p>

              <p>We switched to PNC when we moved to our new city, and I have never been so happy with a bank. I am in my early thirties and am one of the few people I know in my age bracket that was still mailing in my bills and spending money on stamps. After switching to PNC, I decided to get crazy and give online banking and bill paying a try. I love Virtual Wallet! For a visual learner like me, Virtual Wallet is spot-on. Paying bills online, whether on a monthly basis by logging on or by setting up automatic payments, just couldn’t be simpler. I have been recommending PNC and their Virtual Wallet program to all of my friends and family; believe me, everyone knows how pleased I am with PNC! I look forward to trying out many other online tools on PNC’s website … at some point, when I can escape from my toddler’s distractions.</p>
