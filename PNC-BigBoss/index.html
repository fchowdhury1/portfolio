          <h2>Spending Zone</h2>
          <p>It's easy for money to fly out the door, especially when you're having fun. Spending Zone's Spendology<sup>SM</sup> tools provide a simple way to see exactly what you're spending your money on each month — and get a hold on it. Broken down into categories like Education, Restaurants, Gas and more, it allows you to set a budget for each. You can also opt to get handy reminder emails if you're close to maxing out your budget for any category. That way, you can hit the brakes before going over the edge.</p>

          <h2>Money Bar®</h2>
          <p>Get a bird's eye view of what your money's up to. The Money Bar puts it all into three categories: Scheduled Out (the money allocated for bills and other payments), Free (money that's available to spend), and Reserve (the money you've tucked away). It's our way of making everything clearer. Once you've got a good idea of where everything is, you can make adjustments. Need extra money for date night? Got a little left over you want to put toward that vacation? Using the Slider, you can move money back and forth between Spend and Reserve with no effort. Managing your funds is literally in your hands.</p>

You can also see any impending Danger Days<sup>SM</sup> and use Online Bill Pay, which means worrying less and making sure late payments don't happen again. Feeling better already, aren't you?</p>

            <p>I did a lot of research when I wanted to switch banks and thanks to a friend I looked at PNC’s virtual wallet account. Thanks to this account I have never felt more in control of my money. From day to day spending, account balance alerts, and the freedom to move money between my spending and saving account I finally feel like I’m in charge of my money instead of a bank telling me what to do. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any better the Virtual Wallet app opened new doors to mobile money transfers and bill pay. ATM and brand convenience has simply been the icing on the cake. Thank you.</p>

            <h2>AMAZING EXPERIENCE FOR THE NOT-SO-TECH-SAVVY</h2>
            <img class="star" src="img/stars.png" />
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <p>We switched to PNC when we moved to our new city, and I have never been so happy with a bank. I am in my early thirties and am one of the few people I know in my age bracket that was still mailing in my bills and spending money on stamps. After switching to PNC, I decided to get crazy and give online banking and bill paying a try. I love Virtual Wallet! For a visual learner like me, Virtual Wallet is spot-on. Paying bills online, whether on a monthly basis by logging on or by setting up automatic payments, just couldn’t be simpler. I have been recommending PNC and their Virtual Wallet program to all of my friends and family; believe me, everyone knows how pleased I am with PNC! I look forward to trying out many other online tools on PNC’s website … at some point, when I can escape from my toddler’s distractions.</p>
